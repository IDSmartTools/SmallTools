# SmallTools
SmallTools has one advantage and one disadvantage compared to SmartTools. The advantage is that it does not embed plugin information, so it will not report an error when opened in InDesign without the plugin. The disadvantage is that it lacks two features: the stroke feature and the foreground-background glyph feature. The remaining features are exactly the same.

SmallTools与SmartTools相比有一个优点和一个缺点。优点是：不会嵌入插件信息，在缺少插件的InDesign上打开时不会报错。缺点是少了两个功能，一个是笔画功能，一个是前后景字形的功能。剩余的功能完全一样
